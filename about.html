      <p>Hey there! Lavanya this side, just an ordinary 18 year old living an ordinary life. I hail from Mangalore, a city in Karnataka and have lived here my entire life. An ambivert by nature and a big time caninophile. So, don't refrain yourself from spamming me with dog pictures.With that being said, don't ever send me anything related to spiders cause hello there, I'm highly arachnophobic.I'm greatly inclined towards singing and anything related to music. My hobbies include singing, drawing and reading.By the way, I'm not good at introductions, but I could interest you with a sarcastic comment!  </p>
